## 🧠 Model Overview

This platform integrates modular AI components designed for interpretability, ethical alignment, and public-good applications. Models may include:

- Language models for reasoning, summarization, and dialogue
- Classification models for ESG filtering and misuse detection
- Embedding models for semantic search and clustering

## 🎯 Intended Use

- Educational and research applications
- Ethical AI development and interpretability tooling
- Public-good projects in biodiversity, justice, and safety

## 🚫 Out-of-Scope Use

- Financial exploitation or deceptive automation
- Misinformation, surveillance, or discriminatory profiling
- Military or law enforcement use without review

## 📦 Model Architecture

- Transformer-based language models (e.g., GPT-like, Claude-like)
- Lightweight classifiers and filters (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees)
- Embedding models (e.g., sentence transformers, vector encoders)

## 📚 Training Data

- Curated public datasets with documented provenance
- Synthetic data generated under ethical constraints
- Exclusion of known toxic, biased, or exploitative corpora

See [`DATA_SHEET.md`](./DATA_SHEET.md) for full dataset documentation.

## ⚖️ Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy, precision, recall (for classification tasks)
- Interpretability scores (e.g., SHAP, LIME)
- Ethical audit flags (e.g., bias detection, misuse risk)

## 🧪 Limitations

- May underperform in low-resource or multilingual contexts
- Interpretability tools are probabilistic, not deterministic
- Safeguards depend on user configuration and context

## 🗣️ Ethical Considerations

- Models are designed to resist misuse and promote justice
- Safeguards are modular and auditable
- Feedback and oversight are actively encouraged
