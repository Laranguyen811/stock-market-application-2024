# MODEL_CARD.md

## 🧠 Model Overview

This platform integrates externally developed AI models to support interpretability, ethical alignment, and public-good applications. These models are not trained or fine-tuned by this repository, but are wrapped, configured, and safeguarded for responsible use.

## 🎯 Intended Use

- Educational and research applications
- Ethical AI development and interpretability tooling
- Public-good projects in biodiversity, justice, and safety

## 🚫 Out-of-Scope Use

- Financial exploitation or deceptive automation
- Misinformation, surveillance, or discriminatory profiling
- Military or law enforcement use without review

## 📦 Integrated Models

| Model | Source | Purpose | Link |
|-------|--------|---------|------|
| Gemini | Google DeepMind | Summarization, reasoning | [Gemini Overview](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/) |


## 📚 Configuration Notes

- Models are accessed via APIs or local wrappers
- No weights are modified or fine-tuned
- Prompts and safeguards are applied contextually

## ⚖️ Evaluation & Safeguards

While we do not control model internals, we apply:

- Interpretability tools (e.g., saliency maps, feature tracing)
- Ethical filters and misuse classifiers
- Audit logs and reproducible prompts

See [`SAFEGUARDS.md`](./SAFEGUARDS.md) for details.

## 🧪 Limitations

- Model behaviour may vary across updates or API versions
- Interpretability tools are probabilistic, not deterministic
- Safeguards depend on configuration and context

## 🗣️ Ethical Considerations

We acknowledge the power and risks of large models. This platform is designed to resist misuse and promote justice, transparency, and multispecies accountability.

## 🙏 Attribution

We thank the developers of Gemini, Claude, Copilot, and other open-source tools for their contributions to this platform’s architecture and spirit. Their work enables modular, ethical, and collaborative AI development.
